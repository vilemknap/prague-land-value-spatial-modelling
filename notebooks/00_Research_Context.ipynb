    "# Quantifying the spatial impact of public transport accessibility on residential land values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vilém Knap\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates how public transport accessibility, expressed through walking-distance proxies to transit terminals, relates to residential land values in an urban context. Using spatial data from the City of Prague, the analysis combines exploratory GIS techniques with spatial econometric models to quantify both global and local effects.\n"

    "### Motivation and research context\n",
    "\n",
    "Residential real estate listings in large cities frequently emphasize proximity to public transport as a key selling point. Phrases such as “3 minutes to tram”, “5 minutes to metro”, or “excellent public transport accessibility” are commonly used to signal higher attractiveness and, implicitly, higher value of a location. While this intuition is widely accepted in practice, its quantitative expression at the city scale is less straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project starts from a simple question: **to what extent is residential land value related to accessibility of public transport?** Prague provides a particularly suitable case study. As a monocentric city with a dense and multi-modal public transport network, it exhibits strong spatial contrasts between the historic core and peripheral residential areas. At the same time, detailed spatial data on land prices, zoning, and transport infrastructure are publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing on individual housing units, this analysis operates at the level of spatial units (polygons) representing residential land areas, each associated with an average price per square meter. Accessibility is operationalized through walking-distance proxies to the nearest public transport terminals of different modes (metro, tram, bus). The aim of the project is not to predict prices per se, but to **understand how the relationship between transport accessibility and land value varies across space**, and whether this relationship itself exhibits spatial structure.\n"

    "## Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on three primary spatial datasets covering the territory of the city of Prague. Together, they allow the relationship between land value and public transport accessibility to be explored in a spatially explicit manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Land price map (polygons)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core dataset is a spatial land price map provided in polygon form. Each polygon represents a spatial unit with an assigned average land price expressed in Czech crowns per square meter, along with its surface area. These polygons do not correspond to individual parcels or buildings; instead, they represent aggregated land-value zones used for planning and valuation purposes. As such, they provide a suitable spatial resolution for city-wide analysis while avoiding the noise associated with individual property transactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Land-use classification and residential filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the research question is motivated by residential location choice and walking accessibility to public transport, not all land-use categories are relevant. Industrial, logistical, and certain commercial areas follow fundamentally different accessibility logics, where proximity to public transport is either secondary or irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure conceptual consistency between the data and the research question, the land price map is filtered using land-use classification attributes derived from zoning and planning data. Only polygons corresponding to **residential land-use categories** are retained for further analysis. This step ensures that the dependent variable (land price) is examined only in contexts where public transport accessibility plausibly influences perceived value.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Public transport network\n",
    "\n",
    "Public transport accessibility is derived from a spatial representation of Prague’s public transport system. The network is represented using:\n",
    "- **point geometries** for stops and stations (metro, tram, bus, and rail), and\n",
    "- **line geometries** for transport routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the transport network is not treated as a routing or timetable-based system. Instead, it serves as a geometric reference from which proximity-based accessibility measures can be derived. In particular, walking accessibility is approximated using Euclidean distances between residential polygons and the nearest public transport terminals of different modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these datasets establish the empirical foundation for the subsequent exploratory analysis, where initial spatial patterns in land prices and transport accessibility are visually examined before any formal modelling assumptions are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stops: https://data.gov.cz/dataset?iri=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.gov.cz%2Fzdroj%2Fdatov%C3%A9-sady%2F60437359%2F9be08dfbace91ac5a2789a3bb431617b\n",

    "### Administrative boundaries of Prague (RSO)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to spatially restrict the analysis to the territory of the City of Prague, an additional administrative dataset is required. For this purpose, a dataset of **administrative districts of Prague (RSO – správní obvody hlavního města Prahy)** is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of polygon geometries representing individual administrative units covering the entire area of the city. While a single polygon delineating the official boundary of Prague was not available in a suitable vector format, the RSO dataset provides complete spatial coverage of the city territory at a finer administrative resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a city-wide boundary, the individual administrative polygons are aggregated into a single geometry by constructing their spatial union (envelope). This derived boundary is subsequently used as a spatial mask to:\n",
    "- filter public transport stops and lines to those located within the territory of Prague, and\n",
    "- ensure spatial consistency between land price data and transport network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the resulting boundary is derived rather than directly sourced as an official city-limit shapefile, it accurately represents the spatial extent of Prague as defined by its administrative subdivisions. Given the analytical focus on intra-city spatial patterns rather than marginal boundary effects, this approach is considered appropriate and methodologically transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset therefore plays a purely structural role in the analysis, enabling correct spatial filtering and alignment of all other datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://data.gov.cz/datov%C3%A1-sada?iri=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.gov.cz%2Fzdroj%2Fdatov%C3%A9-sady%2F00025593%2Fb312f5045a0feade30e1fcdb7b101ba6\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data availability note\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets used in this project are referenced using currently active public data portals. Where original download links from earlier versions of the project were no longer available, equivalent up-to-date sources were identified to ensure transparency and long-term reproducibility of the analysis.\n"
